# du4tnr: Data Utility for Transparency and Reproducibility
This package was originally developed to help student scholars in their statistical research with a specific dataset.

All datasets are removed and it is being used a general purpose package for collaboration between students. 

Transparency and Reproducibility are achieved through:
- using a table (Data Frame or CSV file) to document initial cleaning steps,
- using a database storage for datasets.

For more information, see [vignette](articles/du4tnr.html).
