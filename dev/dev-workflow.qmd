## Git Workflow
```bash
# Create and switch to feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
# or
git switch -c feature/new-feature

# Daily development on feature branch
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature component"
git push origin feature/new-feature

# Keep feature branch updated with main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/new-feature
git merge main
# or rebase: git rebase main

# Merge feature to main (after code review)
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge feature/new-feature
git push origin main

# Clean up feature branch
git branch -d feature/new-feature
git push origin --delete feature/new-feature

# Deploy main branch
